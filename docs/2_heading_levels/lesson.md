# Heading Levels
Heading levels are used by screen readers to make it easier for users to 
navigate the content on the page

## Rules
* Each page should have at least one `<h1>`
* Pages should be structured in a hierarchical manner
    * `<h1>`: being the most important (usually page titles or main content heading)
    * `<h2>`: usually major section headings
    * `<h3>`: sub-sections of the `<h2>`
    * and so on
* Do not skip heading levels 
    * always follow consecutive order	
* Do not use text formatting, such as font size or bold to give the visual appearance of headings 
    * use actual heading (`<h1>` - `<h6>`) for all content headings
* Do not use headers to achieve visual results only
